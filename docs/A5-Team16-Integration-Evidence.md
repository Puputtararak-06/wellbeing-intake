# A5 — Integration Evidence · Team 16 (Private Wellbeing Intake & Booking)

**Team:** 16 — Wellbeing · **Pod:** 4 — Student Support
**Deployed base URL:** `https://wellbeing-intake.vercel.app/api/v1` (Vercel, region `sin1`) · database: Supabase project `jtwrgfcmfghfklddyatv` (`ap-southeast-1`)
**Commit / deploy ID evidenced:** `818596e` for §5a and §6a, `73b18dc` for §6b, `27d4920` for §3, §4 and §5b, `f2b620c` for §2 (each reported by `GET /health` as `"version"` at capture time)
**Evidence captured on:** 2026-09-21, 05:33–07:56 UTC+7 (§3–§6) and 18:19–18:35 UTC+7 (§2). Timestamps below are ISO-8601 **UTC** (`Z`), exactly as captured; add 7 h for local time.
**Captured by:** Teerapat Sukkasem (6731503015), Team 16

> **Scope of this document.** Team 16 is paired with **one** partner: **Team 14 — Helpdesk**. Team 14
> provides the Provider proof (§2). We are not paired with Team 01 (Identity) or Team 20 (Notification
> Hub), so:
>
> - the webhook proofs (§3, §4, §6a) are real captures from the deployed system, **run by Team 16
>   itself** against our built-in contract mock (`/api/v1/mock/hub`), which verifies the real HMAC
>   signature, platform envelope and `data` allowlist over real HTTP. They prove our side of the
>   contract; they are not a partner's confirmation, and we do not present them as one;
> - the Consumer proof (§1) is out of scope — see §1.
>
> §3, §4 and §5b were first captured at 05:33–05:50 UTC+7 and **re-run at 07:56** with identical results, because Vercel's Hobby plan keeps server logs for about one hour and the first run's log lines had expired before they could be screenshotted. Both runs are kept in the raw captures.
>
> Raw captures: [`docs/evidence/`](evidence).

> Every item below must be a real capture from the deployed system — nothing reconstructed, nothing mocked up after the fact. Anything still marked `TODO` is incomplete.

## Redaction rules (apply to every screenshot and log)

- [ ] Seeded demo users only — no real student record anywhere (platform PRD §6, BR-18).
- [ ] Secrets masked: signing secret, machine credential, service-role key, LLM key, bearer tokens (show first 6 characters at most).
- [ ] No request content (description, free text, preferred times) and no triage level in any capture (NFR-07). Use metadata-only views.
- [ ] Each capture shows its correlation ID (`X-Correlation-Id`) so the log lines and screenshots can be tied together.

## Summary

| # | Proof | Partner team | Our PRD reference | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Consumer | — (not paired with Team 01) | BR-26, FR-03 | **Out of scope** — identity runs in fixture mode |
| 2 | Provider | **Team 14 — Helpdesk** | §11.1 `GET /services`, NFR-18 | **Done** — provider log captured for `team14-a5-0001`; Team 14's own screenshot and contact name still to add |
| 3 | Webhook receiver | — (self-run) | FR-24 (PRD revision 3), `POST /webhooks/notification-hub` | **Done (self-run)** |
| 4 | Webhook sender | — (contract mock hub) | FR-18, NFR-17, §11.5 | **Done (mock hub)** |
| 5 | Idempotency | — (ours) | K-17 `submission_key`; `eventId` | **Done** — 5a and 5b |
| 6 | Degradation | — (contract mock hub / LLM) | K-18/K-19, FR-23, BR-24 | **Done** — 6a (hub outage) and 6b (LLM rate-limited), both with automatic recovery |

---

## 1. Consumer Proof — we call a partner's API

**Status: out of scope for this submission.** Our designed consumer integration is Team 01 — Student Identity: `src/lib/identity/adapter.ts` verifies a Team 01 access token against their published key set when `IDENTITY_MODE=campus` (BR-26). Team 16 is **not paired with Team 01**, so no real Team 01 token exists to capture, and we will not fabricate one.

What is true of the deployed system instead:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Identity mode deployed | `IDENTITY_MODE=fixture` — seeded demo users via Supabase Auth, which BR-26 permits when Team 01 is unavailable |
| Adapter code | `src/lib/identity/adapter.ts` — the only module that verifies a credential. Switching to `campus` is configuration (`IDENTITY_JWKS_URL`, `IDENTITY_ISSUER`), not a code change (NFR-14) |
| Honest limitation | The `campus` path has never been exercised against a real Team 01 token, and it is not covered by our automated tests. Only fixture mode is proven. |

Our only partner, Team 14 — Helpdesk, exposes no API that this product needs to consume, so we did not invent a call to one for the sake of this section.

---

## 2. Provider Proof — a partner calls our API

**What this proves:** Team 14 — Helpdesk successfully consumes a Team 16 endpoint, both by hand (Postman) and from their own deployed backend.

Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/services` — public, returns only the seeded service catalogue, so a partner can call it with no privacy exposure. The agreed contract is [`integration/team14/Team14-Integration-Contract.md`](../integration/team14/Team14-Integration-Contract.md) (v1.2): Helpdesk uses the catalogue to suggest a Wellbeing service on a ticket and stores only the stable `slug`. No student data crosses the boundary in either direction, and no ticket text is sent to us.

### 2a. The evidenced call — correlation ID `team14-a5-0001`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Our endpoint URL | `https://wellbeing-intake.vercel.app/api/v1/services` |
| Calling partner | Team 14 — Helpdesk (`TODO contact name`) |
| Partner's client | Postman (`User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.56.1`) |
| Request timestamp | `2026-09-21T11:35:49.718Z` — 18:35:48 UTC+7 (server time, from our log) |
| Correlation ID | `team14-a5-0001` — sent by Team 14, echoed in our response, written to our log |
| HTTP status returned | `200` |
| Deploy evidenced | `f2b620c`, Vercel production, received in Singapore (`sin1`) |

**Internal request log** (Vercel function log line — method, path, status, correlation ID, caller role; no body):

```json
{ "t": "2026-09-21T11:35:49.718Z", "svc": "wellbeing", "cid": "team14-a5-0001", "method": "GET", "path": "/api/v1/services", "status": 200, "role": "visitor", "ms": 476 }
```

`role: "visitor"` is correct: the endpoint is public, so Team 14 presents no credential and receives exactly what any signed-out visitor receives.

![Vercel log: GET /api/v1/services, status 200, cid team14-a5-0001, User-Agent PostmanRuntime](evidence/2-provider-log-team14-a5-0001.png)

The log search for `team14-a5-0001` returns exactly one request. Team 14's optional labels `team14-a5-0002` (health check) and `team14-a5-0003` (recovery call) were searched for in the same hour and returned no request: they were not sent, so nothing is claimed for them.

**Partner confirmation** (Team 14's own screenshot of the same request — their request, the `200` response, and `X-Correlation-Id: team14-a5-0001` echoed back): `TODO ![partner-confirmation](evidence/2-partner-confirmation.png)`

### 2b. Their deployed backend calling us — not just a manual test

Team 14's Helpdesk API (`https://helpdesk-api.team-helpdesk.workers.dev`, Cloudflare Workers) proxies our catalogue at `GET /wellbeing/services`. Team 14's evidence plan states that this proxy generates its own random correlation ID for every call; the log line below carries an ID of exactly that kind (`team14-a5-<uuid>`), which is how we attribute it to their backend rather than to a person:

```json
{ "t": "2026-09-21T11:19:24.677Z", "svc": "wellbeing", "cid": "team14-a5-c006d636-c04e-4d40-9653-2c1138a03ad4", "method": "GET", "path": "/api/v1/services", "status": 200, "role": "visitor", "ms": 371 }
```

This request shows no browser or Postman user agent: it is a server-to-server call from their Worker, which is how the contract asks them to call us (we send no CORS headers).

![Vercel log: GET /api/v1/services, status 200, cid generated by Team 14's backend proxy](evidence/2-provider-log-team14-backend-proxy.png)

Checked from our side on 2026-09-21: `GET https://helpdesk-api.team-helpdesk.workers.dev/wellbeing/services` → `200`, `"degraded": false`, all four services (`counselling`, `health-clinic`, `physiotherapy`, `wellbeing-advising`).

---

## 3. Webhook Receiver — we receive a partner's event

> **Implemented as FR-24 (PRD revision 3):** `POST /api/v1/webhooks/notification-hub` receives Notification Hub delivery receipts (`notification.delivered` / `notification.failed`) carrying only our opaque `reference`; the signature is verified over the raw body and consumption is idempotent on `eventId`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Sending partner | **Self-run by Team 16**, signed with our own `HUB_INBOUND_SECRET` (no Notification Hub partner — see Scope) |
| Our receiver URL | `https://wellbeing-intake.vercel.app/api/v1/webhooks/notification-hub` |
| Event type | `notification.delivered` |
| Received at | `2026-09-21T00:56:20.136655Z` (database `received_at`) |
| `eventId` | `d277ab91-6e47-40d8-9c63-d65d8e46dc71` |

**Incoming payload** (exactly as received):

```json
{"eventId":"d277ab91-6e47-40d8-9c63-d65d8e46dc71","type":"notification.delivered","occurredAt":"2026-09-21T00:56:16Z","source":"notification-hub","subject":"reference:demo","data":{"reference":"02193392-d6f3-48fc-af68-d887ddaa7349"}}
```

**Secret verification result** — both outcomes:

| Case | Signature header | Result | HTTP status | Correlation ID · response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Valid signature | `sha256=a71e8c…` (masked), `x-signature-timestamp: 1789952176` | verified | `200` | `a5r-3-valid` · `{"received":true,"duplicate":false}` |
| Tampered body — one character changed after signing (`delivered` → `deliverex`), same signature | `sha256=a71e8c…` (masked) | rejected | `401` | `a5r-3-tampered` · `{"error":"invalid_signature"}` |

**Server-side log lines** (Vercel → Logs, production, region `sin1`) — our structured `kind:"webhook_in"` line for each delivery:

| cid | Server time (UTC) | `signature` | `status` | `duplicate` | Work done |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `a5r-3-valid` | `2026-09-21T00:56:20.217Z` | `verified` | 200 | `false` | one database write (External APIs: `POST …supabase.co`) |
| `a5r-3-duplicate` | `2026-09-21T00:56:20.453Z` | `verified` | 200 | `true` | recognised as already seen |
| `a5r-3-tampered` | `2026-09-21T00:56:20.658Z` | `rejected`, reason `mismatch` | 401 | — | **"No outgoing requests"** — rejected in 9 ms, before touching the database |

![Vercel log, cid a5r-3-valid: signature verified, status 200, duplicate false](evidence/3-log-valid.png)

![Vercel log, cid a5r-3-duplicate: signature verified, status 200, duplicate true](evidence/3-log-duplicate.png)

![Vercel log, cid a5r-3-tampered: signature rejected, reason mismatch, status 401, no outgoing requests](evidence/3-log-tampered.png)

**Stored log** — query output from the deployed database (`inbound_event`, filtered by that `eventId` — exactly one row):

```json
[{"event_id":"d277ab91-6e47-40d8-9c63-d65d8e46dc71","source":"notification-hub","type":"notification.delivered","reference":"02193392-d6f3-48fc-af68-d887ddaa7349","received_at":"2026-09-21T00:56:20.136655+00:00"}]
```

## 4. Webhook Sender — we send an event to a partner

**What this proves:** FR-18 / NFR-17 — a signed `appointment.reminder` reaches the Notification Hub target in the platform envelope (here: the contract mock hub).

**Internal trigger action:** student books an appointment (`POST /api/v1/appointments`) → reminder reaches its lead time → dispatcher runs (`POST /api/v1/internal/events/dispatch`).

| Step | Timestamp | Correlation ID | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
**Receiver in this capture:** our contract mock hub (`HUB_WEBHOOK_URL=https://wellbeing-intake.vercel.app/api/v1/mock/hub`), which checks the HMAC signature, the platform envelope and the `data` allowlist before answering `202`. There is no Notification Hub partner — see Scope.

| Step | Timestamp (UTC) | Correlation ID | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booking created | `2026-09-21T00:56:24Z` | `a5r-4-booking` | `201` `{"id":"65132edf-0d2d-4882-9a4e-c340fec2f2b5","startAt":"2026-09-21T06:56:19.269+00:00","status":"confirmed"}` |
| Outbox row inserted (K-18) | same transaction window | — | `event_id 6e6f17f3-9038-449b-b757-9220dfe9ef77`, `type appointment.reminder`, `reference` = the appointment id |
| Dispatcher delivered (inline, right after booking) | `2026-09-21T00:56:24.113613Z` | `a5r-4-booking` | `attempts 1`, `last_status 202`; log screenshots below |

**Outgoing payload** — `data` has exactly 3 fields; no service, practitioner, reason or triage level. The delivered row is nulled (K-19), so this is the `data` block of the identically-built reminder in §6a, read from the outbox while it was still pending:

```json
{ "message": "You have an appointment.", "reference": "fcbe8a2f-0847-4ac3-8a67-1a6f97d825c1", "appointmentAt": "2026-09-21T08:01:25Z" }
```

with `subject` `student:3d77124f-5e2c-4c35-b7da-b8e74d1d0d06` (the recipient's opaque identity reference, a seeded demo user).

Signature header sent: `X-Signature: sha256=<hex>` with `X-Signature-Timestamp` — the mock hub recomputed the HMAC over `"<timestamp>.<raw body>"` and accepted it (`202`). The header value itself is not logged by design, so it is not reproduced here.

**Partner response log:** HTTP status `202` from the mock hub (it answers `401` on a bad signature, `400` on a bad envelope, `422` on `data` outside the contract).

**Server-side log lines — both ends of the delivery, same `eventId` `6e6f17f3-9038-449b-b757-9220dfe9ef77`** (Vercel → Logs, search `a5r-4-booking`; the correlation ID is propagated from the booking request onto the outbound webhook):

| Side | Request | Server time (UTC) | Log line |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sender | `POST /api/v1/appointments` → 201 | `2026-09-21T00:56:24.170Z` | `kind:"webhook"`, `type:"appointment.reminder"`, `attempt:1`, `status:202`, **`outcome:"delivered"`**; External APIs shows the outbound `POST wellbeing-intake.vercel.app/api/v1/mock/hub` |
| Receiver | `POST /api/v1/mock/hub` → 202, user agent `node` | `2026-09-21T00:56:24.139Z` | `svc:"mock-hub"`, same `eventId`, **`accepted:true`** — logged only after the HMAC signature, the envelope and the `data` allowlist all passed |

![Vercel log, sender side: booking 201 and kind webhook line with outcome delivered](evidence/4-log-booking-sender.png)

![Vercel log, receiver side: mock hub accepted the same eventId with status 202](evidence/4-log-mock-hub-receiver.png)

**After delivery** — outbox row, `delivered_at` set and `subject` / `payload` nulled (K-19):

```json
[{"event_id":"6e6f17f3-9038-449b-b757-9220dfe9ef77","type":"appointment.reminder","reference":"65132edf-0d2d-4882-9a4e-c340fec2f2b5","attempts":1,"last_status":202,"next_attempt_at":"2026-09-21T00:56:45.051186+00:00","delivered_at":"2026-09-21T00:56:24.113613+00:00","failed_at":null,"subject":null,"payload":null}]
```

---

## 5. Idempotency Proof — same request twice, one record

Two candidates; submit at least one, ideally both.

### 5a. `POST /api/v1/requests` with the same `submission_key` (K-17)

| | Req 1 | Req 2 (replay) |
|---|---|---|
| Timestamp (UTC) | `2026-09-20T22:33:09Z` | `2026-09-20T22:33:10Z` |
| Correlation ID | `a5-5a-req1` | `a5-5a-req2` |
| `submission_key` | `19267117-022d-4128-a196-1348548429b3` | same |
| HTTP status | `201 Created` | `200 OK` — returns the existing request |
| Returned request id | `a9e01cc4-fac0-4851-9336-3007f9d0380d` | **same id** |
| `created` flag | `true` | `false` |

Payload — byte-identical for both requests (obviously fake description, as required):

```json
{"serviceId":"689dfeea-2a43-4aa9-87b4-55cfacaf29bc","structuredDescription":"demo-sentinel-A5","preferredTimes":"any","triageLevelId":1,"submissionKey":"19267117-022d-4128-a196-1348548429b3"}
```

Response 1:

```json
{"id":"a9e01cc4-fac0-4851-9336-3007f9d0380d","status":"submitted","triageLevelId":1,"submittedAt":"2026-09-20T22:33:13.184206+00:00","created":true,"acute":false}
```

Response 2 — same `id`, same `submittedAt`, `created:false`:

```json
{"id":"a9e01cc4-fac0-4851-9336-3007f9d0380d","status":"submitted","triageLevelId":1,"submittedAt":"2026-09-20T22:33:13.184206+00:00","created":false,"acute":false}
```

**DB proof of single creation:**

```sql
select count(*) from request where submission_key = '19267117-022d-4128-a196-1348548429b3';
-- expected: 1
```

Result from the deployed database (exact count via the REST API, `Prefer: count=exact`): `Content-Range: 0-0/1` → **1 row**.
(To reproduce: run the SQL above in Supabase → SQL Editor.)

### 5b. Inbound webhook delivered twice with the same `eventId` (from §3)

| | Delivery 1 | Delivery 2 (duplicate) |
|---|---|---|
| Timestamp (UTC, server) | `2026-09-21T00:56:20Z` | `2026-09-21T00:56:20Z` |
| Correlation ID | `a5r-3-valid` | `a5r-3-duplicate` |
| `eventId` | `d277ab91-6e47-40d8-9c63-d65d8e46dc71` | same (same body, same signature) |
| HTTP status | `200` | `200` — acknowledged, not reprocessed |
| Response | `{"received":true,"duplicate":false}` | `{"received":true,"duplicate":true}` |

DB proof — one stored row for that `eventId` (the primary key on `inbound_event.event_id` makes a second insert impossible):

```json
[{"event_id":"d277ab91-6e47-40d8-9c63-d65d8e46dc71","source":"notification-hub","type":"notification.delivered","reference":"02193392-d6f3-48fc-af68-d887ddaa7349","received_at":"2026-09-21T00:56:20.136655+00:00"}]
```

---

## 6. Degradation Proof — a dependency breaks, we keep working, we recover automatically

### 6a. Notification Hub unreachable (primary — partner dependency)

**How it was broken:** the hub target was switched into outage mode — `PUT /api/v1/mock/hub {"fail":true}` with the machine credential — so every delivery received `503 {"error":"mock_hub_outage"}` over real HTTP.

One event throughout: `event_id 7639a8f8-ba9a-426a-b960-ab9be25715b0`.

| Moment | Timestamp (UTC) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Breakage | `2026-09-20T22:51:05Z` | cid `a5-6a-break` → `200 {"fail":true}` |
| Booking during outage still succeeds | `2026-09-20T22:51:06Z` | cid `a5-6a-booking` → **`201`**, fallback JSON below |
| Attempt 1 fails (inline) | `22:51:06Z` | outbox: `attempts 1`, `last_status 503`, `next_attempt_at 22:51:39Z` (**≈ 30 s later**), `delivered_at null` |
| Attempt 2 fails (dispatcher) | `2026-09-20T22:51:49Z` | cid `a5-6a-retry2` → `{"enqueued":0,"claimed":1,"delivered":0,"retrying":1,"parked":0}`; outbox: `attempts 2`, `last_status 503`, `next_attempt_at 22:53:03Z` (**≈ 70 s later** — interval growing, same `event_id`) |
| Dependency restored | `2026-09-20T22:52:17Z` | cid `a5-6a-restore` → `{"fail":false}` |
| Automatic recovery | `2026-09-20T22:53:07Z` | cid `a5-6a-recover` → `{"enqueued":0,"claimed":1,"delivered":1,"retrying":0,"parked":0}`; outbox: `attempts 3`, `last_status 202`, `delivered_at 22:53:21Z`, `subject` and `payload` nulled |

**What "automatic" means here:** no row was edited and nothing was re-queued by hand. Recovery was the ordinary dispatcher call picking up the row when its `next_attempt_at` came due. In production that call is made by the scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`dispatch.yml`, every 3 hours); for this capture we invoked the same endpoint at the due times instead of waiting for the schedule.

Pending outbox row during the outage (it still holds its payload — exactly the three allowed fields):

```json
[{"event_id":"7639a8f8-ba9a-426a-b960-ab9be25715b0","type":"appointment.reminder","attempts":1,"last_status":503,"next_attempt_at":"2026-09-20T22:51:39.850353+00:00","delivered_at":null,"failed_at":null,"subject":"student:3d77124f-5e2c-4c35-b7da-b8e74d1d0d06","payload":{"message": "You have an appointment.", "reference": "fcbe8a2f-0847-4ac3-8a67-1a6f97d825c1", "appointmentAt": "2026-09-21T08:01:25Z"}}]
```

The same row after recovery:

```json
[{"event_id":"7639a8f8-ba9a-426a-b960-ab9be25715b0","attempts":3,"last_status":202,"delivered_at":"2026-09-20T22:53:21.05775+00:00","failed_at":null,"subject":null,"payload":null}]
```

The appointment was never affected by the outage:

```json
[{"id":"fcbe8a2f-0847-4ac3-8a67-1a6f97d825c1","status":"confirmed","reminder_published_at":"2026-09-20T22:51:09.759946+00:00"}]
```

**Fallback JSON output** (the booking response returned to the student while the Hub was down — identical in shape to a normal booking; the student is never told, and never blocked, by a notification outage):

```json
{"id":"fcbe8a2f-0847-4ac3-8a67-1a6f97d825c1","startAt":"2026-09-21T08:01:25.449+00:00","status":"confirmed"}
```

### 6b. LLM unavailable (AI capability with deterministic fallback — FR-23, BR-24)

**Dependency:** Groq (`openai/gpt-oss-20b`), the LLM behind the "help me choose" helper. Deploy evidenced here: `73b18dc`.

**How it was broken:** Groq's free tier allows 8,000 tokens per minute. We used that allowance up with one oversized request sent **from outside the app** with the same API key, so Groq answered every further request — including our deployed app's — with `429 rate_limit_exceeded` (`retry-after: 55`). This is a real provider-side failure, not a flag flipped in our own code.

| Moment | Timestamp (UTC) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Before — AI healthy | `2026-09-21T00:33:29Z` | cid `a5-6b-before` → `200`, `mode:"ai"`, two services ranked |
| Breakage | `2026-09-21T00:33:30Z` | burn request 1 → `200`, 156 tokens left; burn request 2 → **`429 rate_limit_exceeded`**, `retry-after: 55` |
| During — helper still answers | `2026-09-21T00:33:32Z` | cid `a5-6b-during` and `a5-6b-during2` → **`200`**, `mode:"fallback"` (below) |
| Automatic recovery | `2026-09-21T00:34:41Z` | cid `a5-6b-recovered` → `200`, `mode:"ai"` again — 69 s later, when Groq's window reset. No redeploy, no configuration change, no action by anyone. |

**Server-side log lines** (Vercel → Logs, production deployment `dpl_9jxBmBLxEWr5BPq9fgrA953Uc…`, region `sin1`). Each screenshot shows our own structured log line and, in Vercel's *External APIs* panel, the outbound `POST api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` made by that request:

| cid | Server time (UTC) | `mode` | `reason` | `ms` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `a5-6b-during` | `2026-09-21T00:33:35.913Z` | `fallback` | `ai_unavailable` | 112 — Groq refused at once |
| `a5-6b-during2` | `2026-09-21T00:33:36.381Z` | `fallback` | `ai_unavailable` | 127 |
| `a5-6b-recovered` | `2026-09-21T00:34:45.502Z` | `ai` | `null` | 920 — a real model answer |

The log lines carry mode, reason, match count and latency only — never the typed text (NFR-07, NFR-10). Server times are about 4 s later than the client timestamps in the table above: the capturing PC's clock runs slightly behind.

Request body in every call: `{"text":"trouble sleeping before exams"}`.

**Fallback JSON output** during the outage — a ranked list of seeded service IDs from the deterministic keyword matcher; the visitor gets an answer, not an error:

```json
{"mode":"fallback","serviceIds":["6c940476-f362-4090-b96a-40d75ed2564b"]}
```

Same call after recovery — the model ranks a second relevant service the keyword matcher did not find:

```json
{"mode":"ai","serviceIds":["6c940476-f362-4090-b96a-40d75ed2564b","689dfeea-2a43-4aa9-87b4-55cfacaf29bc"]}
```

In both modes the response carries **only seeded service IDs** — model-written text never reaches a screen (BR-24).

**Also captured earlier** (`2026-09-20T23:09:24Z`, cid `a5-6b-fallback`, deploy `818596e`): with the capability switched off entirely (`AI_FINDER_ENABLED=false`, no key) the same call returned the same `mode:"fallback"` answer.

**Automated coverage of the fallback triggers:** `tests/unit/finder-ai.test.ts` stubs the network and asserts a fallback on HTTP 500, HTTP 429, a timeout, a network failure, free text instead of JSON, JSON of the wrong shape, an id outside the catalogue, and more than three ids; `tests/integration/platform.test.ts` covers AI switched off, no key, and daily budget exhausted. All green in CI.

## Appendix — how to capture each proof with this codebase

Set once (Git Bash). Use the deployed URL for the real submission; `http://localhost:3000` for a dry run.

```bash
HOST=https://wellbeing-intake.vercel.app
CID=a5-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)            # one correlation id per proof ties screenshots to log lines
login() { curl -s -X POST $HOST/api/v1/session -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "origin: $HOST" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"$1\",\"password\":\"demo-password-16\"}" | node -pe 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0)).accessToken'; }
STUDENT=$(login student.a@demo.test); COUNSELLOR=$(login counsellor.1@demo.test)
```

Server log lines are single-line JSON containing `"cid":"<your CID>"` — in Vercel: Project → Logs → search the CID.

**1 · Consumer (Team 01).** Set `IDENTITY_MODE=campus`, `IDENTITY_JWKS_URL`, `IDENTITY_ISSUER`. Obtain a token from Team 01, then
`curl -i $HOST/api/v1/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM01_TOKEN" -H "X-Correlation-Id: $CID"`.
A `200` with your role proves the adapter fetched Team 01's key set and verified the token. Screenshot the response and the
partner URL (`IDENTITY_JWKS_URL`) being fetched; repeat with a tampered token to show `401`.

**2 · Provider.** Ask the partner to run (and screenshot)
`curl -i $HOST/api/v1/services -H "X-Correlation-Id: team13-a5-0001"`. Your internal log is the line with that `cid`.

**3 · Webhook receiver.** Partner (or a dry run with their secret) POSTs a signed receipt:

```bash
BODY='{"eventId":"'$(node -p 'crypto.randomUUID()')'","type":"notification.delivered","occurredAt":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","source":"notification-hub","subject":"reference:demo","data":{"reference":"'$(node -p 'crypto.randomUUID()')'"}}'
TS=$(date +%s)
SIG=sha256=$(printf '%s.%s' "$TS" "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$HUB_INBOUND_SECRET" | awk '{print $NF}')
curl -i -X POST $HOST/api/v1/webhooks/notification-hub -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "x-signature: $SIG" -H "x-signature-timestamp: $TS" -H "X-Correlation-Id: $CID" -d "$BODY"
```

Valid → `200 {"received":true,"duplicate":false}` and log `"signature":"verified"`. Change one character of `$BODY` after signing →
`401` and log `"signature":"rejected","reason":"mismatch"`. Stored log: `select * from inbound_event order by received_at desc limit 5;`

**4 · Webhook sender.** Book a slot that starts within 24 h (the seed creates one per practitioner ~20 h ahead): submit a request as
the student, open it as the counsellor, book it as the student (UI or API). The booking triggers an inline dispatch. Evidence:
the `kind:"webhook"` log line (`eventId`, `attempt`, `status`, `outcome:"delivered"`), the payload as Team 20 received it, their
confirmation, and `select event_id,type,attempts,last_status,delivered_at,subject,payload from outbound_event order by occurred_at desc limit 3;`
(subject and payload are `null` after delivery — K-19). To show the payload *before* delivery, unset `HUB_WEBHOOK_URL`, book, query the row, then restore the URL and run the dispatcher.

**5 · Idempotency.** 5a: send the *same* body twice —

```bash
KEY=$(node -p 'crypto.randomUUID()'); SVC=$(curl -s $HOST/api/v1/services | node -pe 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0)).services[0].id')
REQ='{"serviceId":"'$SVC'","structuredDescription":"demo-sentinel-A5","preferredTimes":"any","triageLevelId":1,"submissionKey":"'$KEY'"}'
curl -i -X POST $HOST/api/v1/requests -H "Authorization: Bearer $STUDENT" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d "$REQ"   # 201 created:true
curl -i -X POST $HOST/api/v1/requests -H "Authorization: Bearer $STUDENT" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d "$REQ"   # 200 created:false, same id
```

DB proof: `select count(*) from request where submission_key = '<KEY>';` → `1`. 5b: run the proof-3 curl twice with the same `$BODY` →
second response `"duplicate":true`; `select count(*) from inbound_event where event_id = '<eventId>';` → `1`.

**6 · Degradation.** 6a (Hub down): `curl -X PUT $HOST/api/v1/mock/hub -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISPATCH_TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"fail":true}'`
(or have Team 20 take their endpoint down at an agreed time) → book a near-term slot: the booking still returns `201` (the fallback JSON) →
logs show `outcome:"retry_scheduled"` with a growing `nextAttemptAt`, same `eventId` → restore with `{"fail":false}` → the next scheduled
dispatch (or `POST /internal/events/dispatch`) logs `outcome:"delivered"` with no manual data fix: that is the automatic-recovery log.
6b (LLM down): with `AI_FINDER_ENABLED=true`, break `LLM_API_KEY` →
`curl -s -X POST $HOST/api/v1/finder/suggest -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"text":"trouble sleeping"}'` → `{"mode":"fallback",...}`;
restore the key → `{"mode":"ai",...}`. The `kind:"finder"` log lines give the breakage and recovery timestamps.

# Private Wellbeing Intake & Booking — Team 16

Pod 4 (Student Support) of the University Digital Campus Platform. Students privately request a
campus health, counselling or wellbeing service, get safe urgency guidance, and book a confirmed
slot. Sensitive content is visible only to the practitioner who needs it, crisis contacts are
always one step away, and every view of request content is audited.

> **Demo data only.** This is a privacy-by-design prototype on seeded, fictional data (PRD C-11,
> BR-18). Never load real student records, and never put any record in this repo or in screenshots.

- Product requirements: [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)
- API contract (OpenAPI 3.1): [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml)
- Operations: [`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md)

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Route Handlers) on Vercel · Supabase Postgres + Auth · TypeScript · Zod ·
Vitest · GitHub Actions. No analytics, no telemetry (NFR-04).

```
Browser (holds NO database credential)
   │  static pages: service finder shell, /emergency (zero data dependency)
   ▼
Next.js Route Handlers — /api/v1/* — the ONLY data path
   │  src/lib/http.ts       correlation id, default-deny roles, identical 404, origin check, content-free logs
   │  src/lib/identity/     the ONLY module that verifies a credential (fixture | campus)
   │  src/lib/events/       platform envelope, data allowlist, HMAC signing, outbox dispatcher
   │  src/lib/finder/       "help me choose": LLM ranking (Groq) + deterministic keyword fallback
   ▼
Supabase Postgres — deny-all RLS (zero policies); invariants live in the database:
   partial unique indexes (no double booking) · plpgsql transactions (booking, cancel,
   audit-on-read) · append-only triggers · immutable request content · transactional outbox
```

## Run it locally

Prerequisites: Node 22.12+ (or 24), pnpm 10, Docker Desktop (running).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:start                 # local Supabase stack; applies supabase/migrations
pnpm db:env                   # prints API_URL, ANON_KEY, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
cp .env.example .env.local    # paste those three values in, and generate the three secrets
                              # (HUB_SIGNING_SECRET, HUB_INBOUND_SECRET, DISPATCH_TOKEN): openssl rand -hex 24
pnpm seed                     # destroys the dataset and loads demo fixtures (NFR-09 reset)
pnpm dev                      # http://localhost:3000
```

Demo accounts (password = `SEED_PASSWORD`, default `demo-password-16`):

| Role | Email |
| --- | --- |
| Student | `student.a@demo.test`, `student.b@demo.test`, `student.c@demo.test` |
| Practitioner — Counselling | `counsellor.1@demo.test`, `counsellor.2@demo.test` |
| Practitioner — Health clinic | `nurse.1@demo.test` |
| Practitioner — Physiotherapy | `physio.1@demo.test` |
| Practitioner — Wellbeing advising | `wellbeing.1@demo.test` |
| Intake coordinator | `coordinator@demo.test` |

**The demo journey:** browse `/` signed out → try "help me choose" → request a service → sign in as
a student → submit → sign in as that service's practitioner, open the request (logged; status
becomes *In review*) → back as the student, book a time → cancel it. For the escalation edge case
choose **Urgent** on the form.

No Docker? Create a free Supabase project, put its URL and keys in `.env.local`, run
`pnpm exec supabase link` and `pnpm exec supabase db push`, then `pnpm seed`.

## Checks

| Command | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm test` | Unit: payload allowlist, envelope, signing, fallback matcher (no database needed) |
| `pnpm test:integration` | The seven mandated areas + event contract, AI fallback, platform conventions — real route handlers against the local stack. Reseeds first. |
| `pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm lint` | Types and lint |
| `pnpm check:openapi` | Every implemented route is in `openapi.yaml`, and vice versa |
| `pnpm build && pnpm scan:bundle` | No server secret reached the client bundle (PRD R-2) |

Test areas → files: Request, Privacy, Role boundary, Booking, Cancellation, Urgent escalation →
`tests/integration/journey.test.ts`; Reminder, retraction, inbound webhook →
`tests/integration/events.test.ts`; AI + fallback, health, correlation ids, no-analytics →
`tests/integration/platform.test.ts`.

## Integration points

| Direction | Partner | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| We consume | Team 01 Identity | Access-token verification (`IDENTITY_MODE=campus`) | `src/lib/identity/adapter.ts` |
| We provide | any team / Team 23 gateway | `GET /api/v1/services`, `GET /api/v1/health` | `openapi.yaml` |
| We send | Team 20 Notification Hub | `appointment.reminder`, `appointment.cancelled` — signed webhook, platform envelope | `src/lib/events/` |
| We receive | Team 20 Notification Hub | `notification.delivered` / `notification.failed` receipts, idempotent on `eventId` | `src/app/api/v1/webhooks/notification-hub` |

Until Team 20's endpoint exists, `HUB_WEBHOOK_URL` points at the built-in contract mock
(`/api/v1/mock/hub`, only when `MOCK_HUB_ENABLED=true`), which verifies the signature and envelope
over real HTTP. `PUT /api/v1/mock/hub {"fail": true}` with `Authorization: Bearer <DISPATCH_TOKEN>` simulates an
outage for the degradation proof.

Signature scheme (placeholder until Teams 20/23 fix the platform's): `X-Signature: sha256=<hex>` =
HMAC-SHA256 of `"<X-Signature-Timestamp>.<raw body>"`; timestamps older than 5 minutes are rejected.

## Rules for contributors

1. **Never** call `supabase.from()` from a client component, and never give a secret a
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. The browser holds no database credential; RLS is deny-all on purpose.
2. Every route goes through `route()` in `src/lib/http.ts`. Do not hand-roll auth in a handler.
3. Request content is returned by exactly one path (`content-views`). Do not add a second.
4. Never log a request body. Logs carry method, path, status, role, timing, correlation id.
5. Any new field on `app_user` or `request` needs a recorded privacy re-review (NFR-03) — the
   allowlist tests will fail until you update them deliberately.
6. Contract changes go through a versioned `openapi.yaml` / event-schema pull request agreed with
   the affected teams first.

## AI capability

The only AI in the product is the pre-login "help me choose" helper (FR-23). It sends the typed
text plus the public catalogue to a language model and accepts back **only** a list of seeded
service ids — model-written text never reaches a screen. It is off unless `AI_FINDER_ENABLED=true`
and `LLM_API_KEY` is set; on any error, 3 s timeout, invalid output, or exhausted daily budget, the
deterministic keyword matcher answers. Triage is never AI-assisted.

**Provider: Groq** (`src/lib/finder/ai.ts`), through its OpenAI-compatible API — chosen because its
free tier needs no card, which the 0 THB constraint requires (PRD C-04). `LLM_MODEL` defaults to
`llama-3.1-8b-instant`: the task is picking up to three ids out of four, so a small fast model fits
the 3 s budget. `LLM_BASE_URL` can point at any other API of the same format without a code change.

What leaves our server is asserted by `tests/unit/finder-ai.test.ts`: the
typed text and the public catalogue — no cookie, token, identity or request field (NFR-10).
